Flutter Widgets


1 - Scaffold Widget

  A Scaffold Widget provides a framework which implements the basic material design visual layout structure of the flutter app. It provides APIs for showing drawers, snack bars and bottom sheets. Have a look at its constructor and the properties it has.Mar 4, 2019


2 - Safe Area 

Flutter’s SafeArea widget keeps pesky notification bars and phone notches from encroaching on your app's UI. It uses a MediaQuery to check the dimensions of the screen and pads its child Widget to match, making sure your app is safe on both iOS and Android! 


3 - Expanded

Flutter’s Expanded changes the constraints sent to children of rows and columns, instructing them to fill the available space. So wrap your child in an Expanded widget and watch it grow!

4 - Wrap

When you run out of room in your rows and columns, try Wrap instead! The Wrap widget lays out its children like a row or column, but when it runs out of room, it wraps to the next line. Direction, alignment, and spacing properties can help you get the exact look you need. 

5 - Animated Container

You can code up animated changes yourself with explicit animations, or you can let Flutter animate them for you! With the AnimatedContainer widget, you just build it once with a particular attribute (like color), and then rebuild it with a different value. Flutter will automatically animate the change between the two! Plus you can specify the animation length and curve for a custom look.
